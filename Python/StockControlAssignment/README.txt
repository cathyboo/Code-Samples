There are two ways to run the code in this project, the main way is through the unit test file called TestStockControl.py.
This file runs a series of tests designed to make sure methods and functions run as expected and how they handle invalid entries.

The second file is a very simple GUI found in the file buynlargeGUI.py
This is a very simple interface to allow the addition and removal of stock.  It does not have full functionality (you canot move stock from one area to another, get the date released ect.).  The idea would be to build on this GUI to create a proper interface for the clients of Buy 'N Large.
