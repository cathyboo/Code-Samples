<!-- The following javascript sections are to detect the window size the page is displayed in.
     This was used first to detect the window size of mobile devices but it does not work
     as expected, mobile windows always seem to go to the main site and never the mobile site.
     Script to detect a mobile device was included on the index.html page and it was detecting
     a mobile device no problem but when the mobile home page loaded it was being redirected to
     the main site.

     To get it work these sections were taken out but they are back in again so the mobile site 
     can be checked with a pc by resizing the browser window -->
     

<!-- javascript to detect screen width and decide to leave this page and go to
     mobile optimised site instead -->

Welcome to my website!  I am currently a student of the Dublin Institute of Technology, School of Computing, located in the Kevin Street campus and am undertaking a HDip in Computing.  In the past I have studied physics, a BSc in Applied Physics from Dublin City University and a PhD with the Magnetism and Spintronics group in the Trinity School of Physics.
</p>

<p>
I am married to Paul Sheridan, who I met while studying in DCU.  We have one twelve year old son who is in his final year of primary school.  He made his confirmation in April and there is a short video of the day.

<!-- Video tag is a html 5 tag so will not work in older browsers -->
